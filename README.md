Hey,

script 1 was mainly from Mr. Bell's code. I changed some factors in it to make it fit my program and fix some more stuff.

I wrote my own script in the index.html and quiz.html.

style.css was a combination of my own code and Mr. Bell's code.

I scrambled both index.html and quiz.html myself. Improved upon his code by adding:

1, Retractable stuff.

2, Changed theme.

3, Fixed list.

4, A quiz and citation page.

Leave suggestions to richard.su@rns.cc

Toods,

Richard
