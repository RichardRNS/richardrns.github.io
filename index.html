            Spacecraft is defined as "A vehicle used to travel in space by Oxford Languages.<br><br>
            Often times, it refers to vehicles designed to operate, with or without a crew, in a controlled flight pattern above Earth’s lower atmosphere (Britannica).<br><br>
            They are often synonymous with adventure and mystery, and most people link their appearances with either a plane or a space shuttle.<br><br>
            However, the actual vehicles are designed with a variety of shapes.<br><br>
            We would be diving deeper into the reasoning behind this, and the factors that contribute to the various designs of spacecrafts.<br><br>

                        <p>
                            The launch of a spacecraft comprises a period of powered flight during which the vehicle rises above Earth's atmosphere and accelerates at least to orbital velocity. Powered flight ends when the rocket's last stage burns out, and the spacecraft separates and continues in freefall. If the spacecraft has achieved escape from Earth's gravitation, rather than entering Earth orbit, its flight path will then be purely a solar orbit of some description (NASA Science).

                                Spacecraft require an onboard source of electrical power to operate the equipment that they carry. Those designed to remain in Earth orbit for extended periods generally use panels of solar cells, often in conjunction with storage batteries. The shuttle orbiter, designed for stays in space of one to two weeks, uses hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells. Deep-space probes, such as the Galileo spacecraft that went into orbit around Jupiter in 1995 and the Cassini spacecraft launched to Saturn in 1997, are usually powered by small, long-lived radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which convert heat emitted by a radioactive element such as plutonium directly into electricity.

                                The lightness of weight and functional reliability are primary features of spacecraft design (Britannica).
                                This is because heavy spacecrafts need more fuels to launch, and fuels also have weight, thus needing more fuels to support those prior fuels, and ending in a positive feedback loop.
                                However, as technology improve, this limitation is lifted as it is easier to find an equilibrium.
                                For example, the first satellite ever launched was only weighed 83.6kg because of such limitations, but right now, we can easily launch communication satellites weighing more than 6 tonnes, or 6000kg. Some cargo carrier can weigh even more. For example, ESA's ATV weigh 20 tonnes.
                                This allows more efficiency in performing tasks. For example, the ATV mentioned earlier can carry up to 9 tonnes of cargo and experiments to ISS in one flight.

                                In 2019, a group of students in India launched the lightest spacecraft in history, Kalamsat-V2. It only weighs 1.26kg.<br>
                                Surprisingly, the aforementioend "Sprites" is not the lightest. This is because although small, the design is extremely compact, giving Sprites a large mass.<br>

                                When the Soviet Union and the United States flew the first real spaceships just nine years later—far sooner than most experts had predicted in 1952—they were anything but sleek. One was shaped like a bowling ball; the other resembled a Styrofoam coffee cup. (Air & Space Magazine) The shape of spacecraft then changed due to requirements in the cold war of ICBMs and supersonic travel, to depict a streamlined shape. However, a streamlined shape has no particular advantage in the vacuum and is harder to manufacture, so such shape was disposed after the cold war ended.

                                Since there is no air in space, a spacecraft can be more or less any shape. However, it is still partially dictated by whether they spin or not. Some satellites, such as Meteosat, spin and are drum-shaped. Most satellites today are box-shaped and do not spin. Landers is different. They have to withstand extreme heat as they descend through the air at high speed. For example, ESA’s Huygens probe, which landed on Titan, was shaped like a saucer, with a forward-facing heat shield. (European Space Agency)

                                For long stays in space, it is beneficial to have some sort of artificial gravity induced by rotation. Cylinders and toruses are then good options. They are also rather easy to inflate. Furthermore, spheres and cylinders are relatively easier to manufacture, hence making them popular in spacecraft designs. (Wired)<br>

                                For an object to be recognized as a spacecraft, it needs to reach the altitude of 100km, or the Karman Line. This is also the line that is commonly recongized as the boundary between Earth and Space. Therefore, theoretically, there were many objects that should qualify as spacecrafts before Sputnik 1.
