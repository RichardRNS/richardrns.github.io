            An Enlightenment-era secret society founded on 1 May 1776 in Bavaria, today part of Germany. <br><br>
            The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life, and abuses of state power.<br><br>
            The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict by Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, with the encouragement of the Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787, and 1790<br><br>
            In the later years, it continued fighting underground, and was partly responsible of the French Revolution<br><br>
            In recent years, Illuminati refers to organizations that claims to be in relation to the original Bavarian Illuminati<br><br>

                        <p>- Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to James Madison that: <br>
                            "Barruel’s own parts of the book are perfectly the ravings of a Bedlamite" and considered Weishaupt as an "enthusiastic Philanthropist" who believed in the indefinite perfectibility of man and his intention was simply to "reinstate natural religion, and by diffusing the light of his morality, to teach us to govern ourselves"
                            <br><br>
                            - Dr. Tony Page wrote in a translation of Weishaupt's work: <br>
                            "Weishaupt’s plan was to educate Illuminati followers in the highest levels of humanity and morality (basing his teachings on the supremacy of Reason, allied with the spirit of the Golden Rule of not doing to others what one would not wish done to oneself), so that if Illuminati alumni subsequently attained positions of significance and power (such as in the fields of education and politics), they could exert a benevolent and uplifting influence upon society at large. His project was utopian and naively optimistic, and he himself was certainly not without flaws of character – but neither he nor his plan was evil or violent in and of themselves. It is one of the deplorable and tragic ironies of history that a man who tried to inculcate virtue, philanthropy, social justice and morality has become one of the great hate-figures of 21st-century 'conspiracy' thinking"

                                <br>
                                - The Bavarian monarch, on March 2 of 1785, issued another edict that specifically designated the Illuminati as one of the branches of Freemasonry, along with a new ban<br>
                                <br>
                                - Officers and soldiers in the army were required to come forward and confess their relations with the Illuminati, under promise of immunity if ready and hearty in their response, but under pain of disgrace, cassation, or other punishment if refractory<br>
